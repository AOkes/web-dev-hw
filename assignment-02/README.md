# Assignment 2
## Aidan Okes
I decided to take this class because I hold an interest in learning more about Graphic Design, and this class helps me to be able to continue on that path.  Even though this class is not directly what I am looking to do, in terms of web design, it will still aid me in the future, by allowing me to create websites efficiently by myself.

Three things I hope to learn in this class include;
1. Efficient HTML directory organizing.
2. More about CSS.
3. A firm understanding of Markdown.
