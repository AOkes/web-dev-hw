# Assignment 4
## Aidan Okes
1. I visited the whitehouse.gov website from 1996, and it looked extremely simple, unlike most professional websites I see today, and more like a website I had made when I was just starting out with web design. Today it is much more professional looking, with images, a navigation bar, and an actual format to it.
2. The GIT Module taught me a new thing that I somehow have not really ever used, which was the horizontal line command. Besides that, most of this module was quite simple to understand and grasp, and I had little difficulty with it.
