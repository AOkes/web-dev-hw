      <p>
        Xbox One consoles can sometimes be a challenge to setup, I will teach you
        how you can easily setup your console in no time at all.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h2>Step One</h2>
      <img src="./images/step-one.jpg" alt="An image of the back of an Xbox One" title="Xbox One Ports" width="512" height="336" />
      <p>
        First, check the back of your Xbox One console. To the far left side,
        there is a <b>double prong port</b>, which you will plug in your <b>power supply cord.</b>
        After plugging this in, you can plug the other end of the <b>power supply cord</b>
        into a wall socket or power strip.
      </p>

      <h2>Step Two</h2>

      <p>
        Next, find the port on the back of your Xbox One console with the name <b>"HDMI Out"</b>,
        which is right next to the power supply port.  Using your <b>HDMI cable</b>, plug one
        end into this port, and looking at the back of your television, find a port
        called <b>HDMI (1, 2, or 3)</b>, and plug the other end of the cable into this. This
        allows your Xbox One to display image and sound on your television when the <b>input</b>
        on your television is the same as what you plugged the cord into, be it HDMI
        1, 2, or 3.
      </p>

      <h2>Step Three</h2>

      <p>
        Finally, now that you have your console on and displaying video and audio, you
        need to be able to control it. On your Xbox One controller, find the <b>"X Jewel"</b>
        on the face of the controller, and hold it down until it lights up. Next, on
        the top of the controller, find the button with <b>3 symbols</b> next to it, and hold
        it down until it starts blinking <b>rapidly</b>. And finally, find the button with
        the <b>same symbol</b> on your Xbox One console (on the left side facing the front
        of the console), and hold that button down as well until the power button on
        the Xbox One begins blinking, and wait till the blinking stops. Congratulations!
        You are now ready to begin using your Xbox One console.
