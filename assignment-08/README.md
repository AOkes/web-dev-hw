# Assignment 8
## Aidan Okes
1. Most of the basics concerning HTML was old for me, however, learning about semantic markup and divs were new experiences for me.
2. I am anxious to learn about how well we can style using CSS compared to just using HTML.
3. My work cycle for this assignment was much of the same, looking at the materials for this section and reviewing materials from the previous section, then reading on the assignment.  I did all three pages at once so I could keep track of each thing I was doing on the assignments.
