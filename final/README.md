# Final
## Aidan Okes
1. I learned a great deal from this class about Web Development, including the use of GitHub and its repositories, as it helped to be able to post the code out instead of having to bundle up the files to send and not having progress information on your work.
2. I also learned a good amount about Web Design, including the use of CSS more in depth, and some other features including the embedding feature, which I was aware of but not entirely certain of how to implement.
3. My work process for this final was mainly reviewing the old material that we had for the class, and once I felt comfortable, beginning work on the project by setting out a plan for what I felt my website would be good looking like. Once my plan was set it was fairly simple to implement into an actual website.
