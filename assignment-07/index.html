      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <pre>
        And I'd give up forever to touch you
        'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
        You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
        And I don't want to go home right now

        And all I can taste is this moment
        And all I can breathe is your life
        And sooner or later it's over
        I just don't wanna miss you tonight

        And I don't want the world to see me
        'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
        When everything's meant to be broken
        I just want you to know who I am

        And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
        Or the moment of truth in your lies
        When everything feels like the movies
        Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

        And I don't want the world to see me
        'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
        When everything's meant to be broken
        I just want you to know who I am

        And I don't want the world to see me
        'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
        When everything's meant to be broken
        I just want you to know who I am

        And I don't want the world to see me
        'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
        When everything's meant to be broken
        I just want you to know who I am

        I just want you to know who I am
        I just want you to know who I am
        I just want you to know who I am

        I do not own any of this material, as this was used for a school project.
