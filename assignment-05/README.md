# Assignment 5
## Aidan Okes
1. There is only 1 head and 1 body element on each page. The head element contains a page's information, including title, author, and publication date. The body element contains the data that will be displayed on the site for viewers to see.
2. Structural markup embeds information about the structure of a page. However, semantic markup is used to reinforce the semantics of information within the document.
3. My work cycle for this assignment began with me reading about this assignments elements, and then looking at the assignment itself, while referring back to the website's module whenever I ran into a problem in the assignment.
