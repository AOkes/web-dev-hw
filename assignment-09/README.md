# Assignment 9
## Aidan Okes

1. The different selector types select different elements of your page. Universal selects the entire page, element selects an individual element, class selects the class of a div you set, and id selects only an element with a certain id for its div. You may use these differently to select certain parts of a webpage you want to style, instead of just one element or the entire page.
2. My color palette was red, orange, and light blue. I used these colors because orange was Nickelodeon, light blue as I was just a baby in the 90's, and red because it was my favorite color as long as I can remember.
3. My work cycle was very similar to how it usually is with these assignments, however it took me a little longer to get an understanding of CSS, mainly because I thought it was going to be way different than the style element we used, but once I managed to get the hang of it, I was able to work through the assignment without difficulty.
